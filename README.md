# Engine-Dev DX11(Frustum-Culling & AABBs)
Engine Development class at Full Sail University, this was Lab Three where we had to do Frustum Culling using AABBs. *Note: Testing on a drawn frustum, not the actual view frustum.*

We were given a the template for the bare engine, with no rendering code just the layout, and had labs to build up the engine each week. This was Lab Three, where we had to do Frustum Culling on a drawn frustum where it tests AABBs with the frustum to check if it should be culled.
